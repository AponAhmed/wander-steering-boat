# Wander Steering Behavior with Particle Effects

This HTML document showcases a simple animation of a boat moving on a lake, implemented using wander steering behavior. Additionally, it includes particle effects to simulate water movement around the boat.

## Features:

### Boat Movement
- The boat exhibits wander steering behavior, creating a natural and meandering motion.
- The boat is represented by an image that rotates based on its movement direction.
- The boat's speed, steering behavior, and appearance can be customized.

### Particle Effects
- Water particles follow the boat's path, creating the illusion of water movement.
- Each particle is represented by a 10% transparent white circle.
- Particles disappear after 4 seconds, contributing to a dynamic water effect.
- The number and appearance of particles can be adjusted based on preferences.

### Background Image
- The lake background is displayed behind the boat and particles.
- The background image can be replaced with a different image to change the scenery.

### Responsive Design
- The canvas adjusts its size dynamically to the window's dimensions, ensuring a responsive layout.
- The boat, particles, and background adapt to changes in the canvas size.

## Instructions:

1. Replace Image Paths: Ensure that the paths to the boat, particle, and background images are correctly specified in the `src` attributes of the `Image` instances.
2. Image Loading: Images are loaded before starting the animation to prevent rendering issues. Check the browser console for any loading errors.
3. Customize Parameters: Adjust parameters such as boat speed, steering behavior, particle appearance, and background image to achieve the desired visual effect.
4. Experiment: Feel free to experiment with the code, add new features, or further customize the behavior to suit your creative vision.

**Note:** Ensure that the image files referenced in the code are accessible from the HTML file.

Enjoy experimenting with the wander steering behavior and particle effects in this interactive animation!
